# read-from-excel-to-text
A simple python script that reads data from an excel file and saves it to a text file.

Backstory:

I work at an engineering recruitment agency. Since this week is Thanksgiving, we wanted to send e-cards to all of 
our clients and employee candidates. We used JibJab to create the e-card which we can then send to as many people as we want.
The issue came when I had to copy and paste the 400+ email addresses we have saved in an excel file to JibJab. Each email
address had to be separaated by a comma. Rather than manually inserting the commas, I wrote this script that extracts
the email addresses from the excel file, creates a new text file and writes the email addresses into it, each followed by
a comma. Using this script, I can easily copy and paste the list from the text file to JibJab in the format needed for
it to send the e-cards to all of our recipients.

The emails and names in candidates.xlsx are fake and for demonstration only.
